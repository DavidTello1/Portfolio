<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Witcher: Ties Of Destiny is an action Hack and Slash Beat'em up game for PC, in which Geralt and Jaskier will fight hand to hand, killing all their enemies and overcoming the challenges and obstacles in their way, using their unique skills and cooperating in their way to victory.</p>
    <p>This game was made for a university subject in a team of 29, the objective was to simulate the workflow of a AAA game studio and develop an engine and a game at the same time in the span of three months.</p>
<br>

<h3>Role</h3>
    <p>I was in the programming team, for the first half of the project I worked on the Engine doing the UI System and on the second half I focused more on gameplay programming.</p>
    <p>In the next section I have detailed the features I implemented for this project.</p>
<br>

<h3>Features</h3>

<h5>UI System</h5>
    <p>Programming the structure and main functionalities of the system, like creation/deletion, billboarding, textures, canvas system, etc. Also implementing the first working versions of the Button, Image, Canvas and Circular Bar elements.</p>
<br>

<h5>Game Loop</h5>
    <p>Implementation of the win and lose cycle in the game.</p>
<br>

<h5>Checkpoint System</h5>

<br>

<h5>Credits Scene</h5>
    <p>Coding the credits scene.</p>

<h5>Horde System</h5>
    <p>Creation of a system to spawn rounds of enemies that allows the easy modification of its parameters, like number of enemies, delay between rounds, spawn rate, etc.</p>
