<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This project was made for a university subject in a team of 7.</p>
    <p>The requirements for this project were to make a 2D isometric Real-Time-Strategy game inspired by Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2.</p>
    <p>The game we made is a mix between the classic RTS games and the tower defense genre. There are two players and their objective is to destroy the opposing headquarters by constructing offensive and defensive buildings and managing their resources wisely.</p>
<br>

<h3>Role</h3>
    <p>My role in this project was to be the lead programmer, my main mission was to make good and well structured code for the game and ensure other team members followed the coding guidelines.</p>
    <p>I was in charge of coding the main core of the game and first versions of new features as well as to help other teammates with code related issues.</p>
<br>

<h3>Features</h3>

<h5>Core</h5>
    <p>- Base: Created the base framework and prepared it to be used to start coding the game.</p>
    <p>- UI System: Implemented the first version of the UI system and coded the actions and logic.</p>
    <p>- Entity Manager: Created the entity manager module, a factory class to manage all the entities in the scene.</p>
    <p>- Buildings: Created the first versions of the buildings.</p>
<br>

<h5>Build System</h5>
    <p>Implemented the system to place and build buildings. Showing a preview of the building and the restrictions when placing it.</p>
