<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Game made for the Grand CITM GameJam, the theme was 'women in STEAM jobs'.</p>
    <p>We were given 36h to complete the game and publish it to itch.io, and won the Best Technology Prize to the game with the best technical quality.</p>
    <p>S-TEAM is a 3D puzzle game made in Unity where the player must swap between five women, each one with a power representing a field of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics). In order to solve the puzzles and complete the game, you will have to combine their skills, which are:</p>
    <p>- Science: Change her physical size.</p>
    <p>- Technology: Repair electronic circuits.</p>
    <p>- Engineering: Push heavy objects.</p>
    <p>- Art: Create stairs or doors by painting them.</p>
    <p>- Mathematics: Decipher hidden messages.</p>
<br>

<h3>Role</h3>
    <p>I was one of three programmers of the project. For the design aspect of the game we did a brainstorming session to gather ideas and then we decided as a group what the final product would be.</p>
    <p>In the next section I have detailed the features I implemented for this project.</p>
