<h2>Role</h2>
This project was made for a university subject in a team of 2. 
We didn't have specific roles during the development of the project, instead we both did a little bit of everything. 
In the next section I have detailed the features I implemented for this project.

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Level Design</h3>
The game was required to be a 2D platformer with two levels.
The levels were designed taking inspiration from Super Mario Bros games, //***
//***
- coins
- grids
- boxes
- level transition

<h3>Entity System</h3>
The entity system is a factory class that manages the creation and deletion of all the entities and ensures they are updated accordingly.
The entities are the following;
- Player: the player controled by the user, including its movement and interactions: jump, wall-jump, dash and grip.
- Coins: coins you can collect that give you points.
- Grids: moving grids you can grip to advance the level.
- Enemies: there are two enemies in the game, one is grounded and the other flies. Its AI system is very straightforward: if the player enters in its range it will persue them, if not just stay put.
- Boxes: special boxes that are keys to advance the level, interconnected with the boxes in the other level.

<h3>Scene Manager</h3>
The scene manager is in charge of loading and saving the level data, and transitioning from one map to another.
//***

<h3>UI System</h3>
The UI system is in charge of all the UI elements in the scene, used for creating all the menus and the HUD.
//***

<h3>Music and SFX</h3>
Using SDL to manage the audio files, I added a theme for the main menu and another one for the levels. I also added some sound effects for the player interactions, like picking up a coin, jumping or dying.
