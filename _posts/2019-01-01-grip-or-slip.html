<h3>Role</h3>
<p>This project was made for a university subject in a team of 2.</p>
<p>We didn't have specific roles during the development of the project, instead we both did a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>In the next section I have detailed the features I implemented for this project.</p>

<br>

<h3>Features</h3>

<h5>Level Design</h5>
<p> 
    <p>The game was required to be a 2D platformer with two levels.</p>
    <p>The levels were designed taking inspiration from Super Mario Bros games, //***</p>
    <p>//***</p>
    <p>- coins</p>
    <p>- grids</p>
    <p>- boxes</p>
    <p>- level transition</p>
</p>
<br>

<h5>Entity System</h5>
<p>The entity system is a factory class that manages the creation and deletion of all the entities and ensures they are updated accordingly.</p>
<p>The entities are the following;</p>
<p>- Player: the player controled by the user, including its movement and interactions: jump, wall-jump, dash and grip.</p>
<p>- Coins: coins you can collect that give you points.</p>
<p>- Grids: moving grids you can grip to advance the level.</p>
<p>- Enemies: there are two enemies in the game, one is grounded and the other flies. Its AI system is very straightforward: if the player enters in its range it will persue them, if not just stay put.</p>
<p>- Boxes: special boxes that are keys to advance the level, interconnected with the boxes in the other level.</p>
<p>//***</p>
<br>

<h5>Scene Manager</h5>
<p>The scene manager is in charge of loading and saving the level data, and transitioning from one map to another.</p>
<p>//***</p>
<br>

<h5>UI System</h5>
<p>The UI system is in charge of all the UI elements in the scene, used for creating all the menus and the HUD.</p>
<p>//***</p>
<br>

<h5>Music and SFX</h5>
<p>Using SDL to manage the audio files, I added a theme for the main menu and another one for the levels. I also added some sound effects for the player interactions, like picking up a coin, jumping or dying.</p>
