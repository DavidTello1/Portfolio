<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Witcher: Ties Of Destiny is an action Hack and Slash Beat'em up game for PC, in which Geralt and Jaskier will fight hand to hand, killing all their enemies and overcoming the challenges and obstacles in their way, using their unique skills and cooperating in their way to victory.</p>
    <p>This game was made for a university subject in a team of 29, the objective was to simulate the workflow of a AAA game studio and develop an engine and a game at the same time in the span of three months.</p>
<br>

<h3>Role</h3>
    <p>I was in the programming team, for the first half of the project I worked on the Engine doing the UI System and on the second half I focused more on gameplay programming.</p>
    <p>In the next section I have detailed the features I implemented for this project.</p>
<br>

<h3>Features</h3>

<h5>UI System</h5>
    <p>Programming the structure and main functionalities of the system, like creation/deletion, billboarding, textures, canvas system, etc. Also implementing the first working versions of the Button, Image, Canvas and Circular Bar elements.</p>

    </div>
    <span class="caption text-muted">UI Elements</span>
<br>

<h5>Game Loop</h5>
    <p>Implementation of the win and lose cycle in the game.</p>
    <p>When both players die, the loose animation is showed and they restart from the last checkpoint. When the game is completed the win animation is shown and the credits scene is loaded.</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ page.images.victory | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" style="max-height: 270px;">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ page.images.defeat | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" style="max-height: 270px;">
    </div>
    <span class="caption text-muted">Win & Loose Animations</span>
<br>

<h5>Checkpoint System</h5>
    <p>Implementation of the checkpoints in both levels as well as some debug functions to make testing easier.</p>
    <p>When a player has been defeated, the other player can go to any campfire and revive their partner.</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ page.images.checkpoints | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" style="max-height: 300px;">
    </div>
    <span class="caption text-muted">Checkpoints</span>
<br>

<h5>Credits Scene</h5>
    <p>Creating the system to display the credits. The scene is a small environment with a fixed camera where the players can move, later the horde system was added to give more interactivity for the players.</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ page.images.credits | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" style="max-height: 300px;">
    </div>
    <span class="caption text-muted">Credits Scene</span>
<br>

<h5>Horde System</h5>
    <p>Creation of a system to spawn rounds of enemies that allows the easy modification of its parameters, like number of enemies, delay between rounds, spawn rate, etc.</p>
    <div class="text-center">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="{{ page.images.hordes | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" style="max-height: 300px;">
    </div>
    <span class="caption text-muted">Horde System</span>
